I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University. At my core, I specialize in making AI models more computationally efficient and robust across various environments.

For my doctoral research, I focus heavily on Neuro-AI, exploring how neuroscience-inspired learning and neuromorphic computing can naturally improve fault tolerance and resource efficiency. Beyond my immediate lab work, I am fascinated by the capabilities of large language models and the intersection of AI with healthcare, particularly in biomedical signal analysis.

Outside of academia, my interest in health translates into a personal passion for wellness and longevity. To disconnect, I focus on staying active with strength training, exploring new places, and spending time outdoors hiking.
